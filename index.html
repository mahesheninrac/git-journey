                India’s energy supply mix is projected to undergo a significant transformation by 2035, with renewables
                and new energy sources playing a dominant role. According to National Electricity Plan released in 2024-
                the peak electricity demand in India is anticipated to grow by 11% from the current levels (Apr’2025)
                and reach 277 GW by March’2027. <br><br> To meet the projected demand, the total installed power
                generation
                capacity is expected to reach 610 GW by March 2027, reflecting a growth of approximately 28%. Of this,
                around 48%—equivalent to 284 GW—is anticipated to be contributed by renewable energy sources. As per
                SECI/MNRE and plans by various States/UTs, additional renewable energy capacity is expected to be added
                by March 2027. <br><br> To support round-the-clock power, this includes approximately 40 GW cumulatively
                of
                wind
                and solar, along with battery energy storage systems (BESS), all of which have been considered for
                transmission planning.

                    Opportunity for the Grid Operators
                </strong>

                Green energy transition poses challenges as well as opportunities for the grid operators. Grid
                integration of renewable energy involves navigating key challenges, that if approached innovatively,
                could unlock new business opportunities.<br> <br> The growing integration of renewable energy sources
                (RES)
                into
                electric grids presents significant opportunities for investment and innovation. First, the increasing
                need for grid infrastructure upgrades in high-potential renewable zones opens avenues for developing
                advanced network expansion and optimization solutions. Second, the rising share of RES creates strong
                demand for real-time monitoring and control technologies at the distribution level. <br><br> This
                includes
                solutions that enhance grid stability, ensure voltage and frequency consistency, and mitigate harmonic
                distortion—critical for maintaining high reliability standards in modern power systems.

                For integrating standalone BESS, an investment requirement of USD 75 Million is anticipated by 2030. For
                modernization & strengthening of the power systems, India would require an investment of USD 425 Million

            <p>
                Current grid planning tools and methodologies are insufficient to effectively optimize existing capacity
                or strategically design new, efficient infrastructure. Traditional power flow models struggle to
                accommodate extended planning horizons and evolving uncertainties in both electricity demand growth
                (including load profiles) and supply characteristics (location, availability, dispatchability). These
                limitations hinder the ability to align with emerging regulatory frameworks.
                As a result, grid operators face significant challenges in modeling uncertainty across a diverse range
                of dynamic variables, including:
